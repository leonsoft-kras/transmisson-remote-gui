parts:
  # This part brings in the transgui package from the Ubuntu Archive. In future
  # I will probably try to build this manually, but the Ubuntu package is quite
  # useful for now until the Upstream is patched to work with newer distros or
  # updated to use GTK3.

  # This part installs the `desktop-launch` script which initialises desktop
  # features such as fonts, themes and the XDG environment. It also installs
  # the GTK2 runtime libraries.
  #
  # It is copied straight from the snapcraft desktop helpers project. Please
  # periodically check the source for updates and copy the changes.
